<div style="padding:6px;">
  <p>Ever since I was little, I have always been interested in art. Fascinated by the world of art I saw everywhere; from the billboards on freeways to the cartoons on TV that I watched in my grandma’s house, I knew at that point I wanted to become an artist. These works of art are a physical and mental picture of my journey as an artist and how I see myself in the world of art. Exploring with different mediums and challenging myself to new mediums is something I enjoy experimenting with as an artist to learn and improve my skills. But my true calling to art is to be able to convey a deeper meaning than what meets the eyes. There is a saying that my dad told me when I was a kid that has stuck with me ever since; it was “a picture is worth a thousand words” and I truly live by it. It is also my goal to spread this message as a future educator. </p>
  <p>I have been a traditional artist for most my life starting from when I was 5 years old until I was around 16. And during that time, I had been hopping around through different art schools and art classes which helped me solidify my knowledge and the skills I have today with acrylic paints, pencil drawings, and color pencils specifically. I was lucky to have both my parents be my biggest supporters of my dreams as an artist. As a Chinese American, I can say it hasn’t been easy to convey other family members and friends of my career path, but this was definitely a factor that motivated me to try and pursue this career. Throughout my life, I have always felt a stigma against artists and that all of them were poor and dumb so they “had to become artists” or people thinking that being an artist is a useless skill. And I think this is one of the biggest motivations to my journey of being an artist was wanted to prove these people wrong by means of communication through my artworks. In my eyes, art is everywhere. From the parks in neighborhoods to roads; it is everywhere. There was a designer for all of these daily encounters we see in our regular routines and without them, who knows what our world would look like now. For the people who can’t understand this concept, I want to make artworks that can convey to their emotion and relay that there is a deeper meaning to being an artist and to art. </p>
  <p>Making art leaves no barriers to what the mind wants to convey. Working as not only a traditional artist, but as a multimedia artist now, I think it is the perfect material to use to send my message as each medium can be used to convey different things. Art is something that is always changing and expanding and I want to be able to keep up with the times by exploring and experimenting in all types of mediums like coding, digitally drawing, sculpting, 3D laser cutting, and etc. </p>
